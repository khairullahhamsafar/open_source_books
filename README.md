# 💛 Emerging and Computing Technologies 💚
## Free and Open Source Books Collection 📚
Welcome to this repository dedicated to hosting an array of free and open-source books centered around computing, with a particular focus on emerging technologies. It's essential to note that the books featured here are not authored by me, but are accessible in various formats across the internet. In an effort to enhance reader convenience, I will be presenting these works in Markdown format. However, in instances where conversion proves challenging within the time constraints, the book will be made available in PDF form, and I extend my apologies for any inconvenience.

# Copyrights Disclaimer 🌐
Every effort will be made to provide the original sources along with links, ensuring due credit to the authors. In cases where the authorship is unknown, transparency will be maintained. If anyone asserts a rightful claim with substantial evidence, please feel free to reach out via email. I am committed to promptly acknowledging and crediting the deserving author.

# Invitation 🚀
I encourage readers to engage with the content, fostering a culture of learning, critical thinking, and progression. Let's embark on a journey of exploration, knowledge acquisition, and intellectual growth. I invite you to read, learn, think, and progress on your journey through the wealth of knowledge offered in this repository.

_Kind regards,_<br/>
